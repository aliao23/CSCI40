	<div class=cake><p>Initial reasoning</p></div>
	<p>There isn't really a prominent liberal arts education programme in England which made me prefer the American system more. I also wanted to escape the (fairly) bad weather and have a drastic change of scenery.</p>

	<div class=chocolate><p>What really sold me</p></div>
	<ol><span class=burger>
	<li>The proximity of In-N-Out</li>
	<li>The picture of the cube at night (as seen above)</li>
	<li>The small class sizes and the quality of professors</li>
	</span></ol>
