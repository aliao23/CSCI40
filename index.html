	<div class=banner><p>Initial thoughts</p></div>
	<p>For a <a href="second.html">college that is known for having some of the happiest students</a>, we sure are stressed out all the time, even though the school year is just beginning. My priority as first year class president is to combat stress among freshman and work with ASCMC to better address mental health and wellness. Even before orientation is over, <a href="third.html">institutes are shoving application due dates down our throats</a>, and the stress that I’ve seen put on many of my friends from those applications is unacceptable. The year is just starting, and academically, it’s only going to get harder, and I refuse to be president of a constantly stressed-out class.</p>

	<div class=banner><p>A focus on what you want</p></div>
	<p>
		Some long-term plans I have for this year include creating new study spaces and working with CMC’s Diversity and Inclusion Committee to better provide for our minority students, as well as:
	</p>
	<ol><span class=minilist>
	<li>First year social events such as a 5C tour-de-france-style skateboard/scooter dash</li>
	<li>Making sure minority and affinity groups get more events</li>
	<li>Collaboration with ASCMC to create destressing events</li>
	</span></ol>

	<div class=banner><p>Your involvement</p></div>
	<p>While I have my own visions for how CMC can be improved, it’s crucial that my focus be on your dreams for CMC. Whether it’s a certain type of party you want, or an institutional problem you want addressed, it’s my desire and responsibility to amplify your voices as a representative of my fellow first years. <br>I’m so grateful and happy to be here, and that means I’m also fully committed towards you guys and fully driven toward making this year the best it possibly can be. So let’s dream up our ideal freshman year together; <b>dream up your CMC with me.</b><br></p>
