	<p>Most clubs at CMC are affiliated with ASCMC, which stands for Associated Students of Claremont McKenna. The organisation is democratic and run by an elected Executive Board, which determines funding towards lots of societies as well as creating events.</p>
	<p>Most clubs at CMC can be grouped into three main sections:</p>

	<div class=thirdbanner><p>Academic clubs</p></div>
	<p>These are usually associated with one of the subjects or majors offered at CMC.</p>
	<ul><span class=thirdminilist>

	<li>Chinese Political and Societal Studies Club</li>
	<li>Claremont Accounting Association</li>
	<li>Claremont Consulting Group</li>
	<li>Claremont International Relations Society</li>
	<li>... and many more!</li>
	</span></ul>
