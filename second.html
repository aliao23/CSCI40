	<p>Claremont McKenna is located on a "a scenic, tree-lined residential campus 30 miles east of Los Angeles": a beautiful campus with modern features</p>

	<div class=banner><p>The teaching style</p></div>
	<p>As Claremont McKenna is an American liberal arts college, it has a distinctive teaching style in comparison to larger research universities.</p>
	<ol><span class=minilist>
	<li>Small class sizes</li>
	<li>Dedicated professors</li>
	<li>Inter-5C resource pool</li>
	</span></ol>

	<div class=banner><p>Your involvement</p></div>
	<p>While I have my own visions for how CMC can be improved, it’s crucial that my focus be on your dreams for CMC. Whether it’s a certain type of party you want, or an institutional problem you want addressed, it’s my desire and responsibility to amplify your voices as a representative of my fellow first years. <br>I’m so grateful and happy to be here, and that means I’m also fully committed towards you guys and fully driven toward making this year the best it possibly can be. So let’s dream up our ideal freshman year together; dream up your CMC with me.</p>
